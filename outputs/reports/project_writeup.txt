It seems to me that one of the best skills a data professional can have to is to be curious and a quick learner.
Being curious makes you apt to think deeply about every domain you're tasked with learning about. If you don't find 
"the pleasure in finding things out" as Feynman says, it will be hard to get into the statistical and analytical weeds
with the domain. Thinking deeply about the material, stakeholders, and outcomes of your work can help raise ethical
alarm bells and keep you motivated while you sift through minutiae of the problem you've been asked to investigate or solve.

So...First, I had to do some reading.
The main article I used for this project is "Food deserts in Winnipeg, Canada: a novel method for measuring a complex
and contested construct" (Slater et. al, 2017). Here, the author's define a sufficient food retail space as having
"sufficient variety at affordable cost" (p. 350), while a "failure to include local full-serivce grovery stores when identifying
food deserts may lead to an overestimation of their size." (p. 350).

In the article, (Slater et. al, 2017)  outline to scenarios for food deserts, the first being where a resident lives >500m from
a national chain grocery store, and the second being where a resident lives >500m from a national chain grocery store or a
full-service grocery store.

National chains are easy to identify, but what is a full-service grocery store? Well, they aren't convenience stores, which
(Slater et al, 2017) says have limited selection at higher prices. Full-service grocery stores are "fair-priced".

Where my methodology then diverges from this paper is in how the data is collected. (Slater et. al, 2017) took their
grocery stores from yellow pages and then used dieticians to verify the quality of food (fruits and vegetables beyond potatoes
and other basics, not prepacked, meat and dairy close to national chain prices). I will be using volunteered data from 
OpenStreetMaps which I will then verify using reviews, photos of the interior of the store and other means.

First Issue

As (Slater et. al, 2017) notes, it's tough to universally define what a proper grocery store is, and what meets the threshold
of affordability and proper variety. Using the tag of 'supermarket' when querying OSM, some stores are *arguably*  incorrectly omitted.
For example, 'Indian Brothers Grocey & street food' has many veggies, fruits, and dairy, but not much meat. Also, the foods
are centred around Indian cuisine; does that disqualify them? For people that exclusively cook Indian food and are vegetarian,
the answer should be no. But for someone who doesn't, the answer is yes. Perhaps the only grocery stores that should qualify
contain enough variety so that everyone can reasonably find, or cook using recipes, things they'll want to eat. In this case,
the only answer should be large grocery stores with common and culturally specific spices, meats, and vegetables. Does Young's
qualify? 

I used the term 'common' to refer to meats, spices, and vegatables that are ubiqituous. But ibiqituous for whom? As you can see,
this get's tricky, and this is why it's important for a data professional to be curious, inquisitive, and willing to 'get into
the weeds' on concepts, like any domain-specific scientist or analyst would.

Here's another, just because I'm on a roll with this: do vegetarian stores count? Meat is no longer needed to be included in the
definition. How do you value a vegetarian-centric variety of foods compared to an cultural-centric variety of foods. Does tripe
have a greater value than jackfruit or lemongrass shoots?

When I was travelling in South America, I lived in a small town called Ayampe, population 400, on the Ecuadorian coast. I had to
take a bus across an enormous headland, with it's own cloud forest microclimate to get to a grocery store with fresh veggies and
meat. But even still, when I entered the grocery store in Montanita for the first time, the selection of fruits, veggies, and dairy
made it feel like I was in a food desert, or more aptly named, a food mirage; There was food there, but I couldn't even read the
labels or make sense out of how to build meals from the ingredients I saw. Is that what it's like when an immigrant to Canada
walks into Safeway for the first time?

How does that thought experiment relate? Because, as a lifelong consumer of O'Henry bars, Kraft dinner, and Hamburger Helper,
I'm prone to bias what I think is a proper selection of groceries, as being a part of my White, Ukrainian heritage diet. But
cultural food deserts exist for someone who is looking for paneer and fresh fenugreek in an aisle of Cheemo perogies.

Is this too deep into the weeds? I argue that it's not. I need my methodology to be defensible to politicians, a general
audience, urban planners, independent grocery store owners, and finally to all citizens.

I can now see one reason why (Slater et. al, 2017) conferred with dieticians on their choice of qualifying grocery stores.
It's another experts opinion. It's methodology back up. And finally, it helps ease what can be a complex, overwhelming decision
in a project's methodology.

So, what can I do? Using the same choices as Slater, I will split up supermarkets like No Frills and Wal-Mart from smaller, niche
grocers. However, I don't have dieticians to confirm selection at these shops, so I will exclude them. A few 'outliers' that I will
include in the 'supermarket' category is Dino's, Young's and Lucky and Giant Tiger.


Workflow in general:

1) Obtain addresses of all grocers included in the analysis, and create a script that gets a geometry node from their address field(s).

2) Using parcel assessments data, put each parcel into the correct neighbourhood.

3) Using previously acquired population of Winnipeg neighbourhood data from 2021 census, devise a one to proportionally place a citizen
into a residential parcel. Decide on methodology for that.

4) Create a centroid for each residential parcel node.

5) Find the distance from each residential node to the nearest grocer node.
    a) As the crow flies, straight-line distance
    b) Learn how to use the road map of the city to calculate the travelling distance.
